0.1:
This is a first release

0.2:
jpvtx will now wait about 1 second (3000 packets) before reading ~/jpcam_pids.
This should ensure, that when used via a pipe with jpcam, that the pids have
been updated to the newly selected channel.
In the case pids are specified on the command line there is no delay.
