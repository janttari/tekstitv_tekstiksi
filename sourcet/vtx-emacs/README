This distribution contains three things: vbidecode, vtx2ascii and
vtx.el.  I've written the latter; the two other things come from other
distributions.

vtx.el is an Emacs interface to teletext pages.  It starts vbidecode
in the background, and uses vtx2ascii to do the translation from vtx
format to human-readable format.

You need to have xawtv properly installed for this to work, and you
also need Emacs 20.3 or XEmacs 21 or better.  And this probably only
works under Linux.

To compile, just say "make" in the main directory.  Then add the
following to your .emacs file:

(require 'cl)
(autoload 'vtx "vtx" nil t)
(push "~/vtx-emacs/lisp" load-path)

vtx-emacs is provided as is, in the hope that someone else (other than
myself) will find it useful, but it's just something I hacked together
one snowy night, and is not something that I maintain actively.
